# My Hangman Game

This is my third milestone assignment with Code Institute. Hangman game is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.
This is a classic hangman game, where the user tries to guess the secret word letter by letter.
The number of incorrect guesses before the game ends is 7.

This site is targeted toward people who have an interest in simple word guessing games and Python.

##  User Experience (UX)

- ### User stories

    -   #### As a User, I want to be able to:

        1. Clearly understand how to navigate and start the game.
        2. Easily find instructions on how to play the game.
        3. Understand what input is required to proceed and that any exception is returned with a message to the user without causing the game to crash.
        4. Clearly see the number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.
        5. Clearly see what the secret word was if the user fails to guess it before the game ends.
        6. Continue playing the game once the game has finished without having to reenter the initial inputs from when the game started.
        7. Have a fun time playing the game and that it functions as expected.

## Flow chart
  - To explain the game logic, I created a flow chart using Lucidchart:
